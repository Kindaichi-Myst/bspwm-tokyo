# bspwm-tokyo
Personal bspwm configuration for backup
(don't use this, it will probably not work, this is
only me dumping my backup .config folder).

Everything goes into ~/.config/

Dependencies are 

`nerd-fonts-jetbrains-mono`

`ttf-font-awesome-5`

`vim-plug` has to be set up for Neovim

(I guess? Once something breaks I will have to figure out
what else is missing).

Of course `picom`,`rofi` and `polybar` have to be installed.

Picom still needs further configuration for Nvidia to avoid
tearing.
